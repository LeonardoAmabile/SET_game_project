### Write_txt.cpp ###
----------------------------------------------------------

This code defines a function `write_data` that saves information about the results of processing a set of matrices (tables) into a text file. It takes the number of "SETs" found in each table and the matrices themselves as inputs, and writes the following information into a file:

Definition:
-----------
void write_data(
    const string& filename,
    const vector<int>& SETs_count,
    const vector<Table>& matrices
)

Purpose:
--------
Writes analysis results and the content of multiple `Table` objects to a `.txt` file. The report includes:
- General parameters (card/attribute/table count)
- SETs statistics
- The contents of each table

Parameters:
-----------
- const string& filename  
  → The name of the output file to be created (e.g., "output.txt").

- const vector<int>& SETs_count  
  → A list of integers, where each value represents the number of SETs found in a corresponding table.

- const vector<Table>& matrices  
  → A list of Table objects to be printed to the output file.

Process:
--------
1. Opens a file stream to the given filename.
   - If the file cannot be opened, prints an error and exits the function.

2. Extracts parameters:
   - Number of tables (N_tables)
   - Number of cards per table (n_cards)
   - Number of attributes per card (n_att)

3. Writes metadata to the file:
   - Number of cards
   - Number of attributes
   - Number of tables

4. Writes the number of SETs found in each table as a space-separated list.

5. Calculates:
   - How many tables had zero SETs.
   - The probability (percentage) of generating a table with no SETs.
   - The average number of SETs across all tables.

6. Writes the raw table data:
   - Each table is printed row by row.
   - A blank line separates each table.

Output:
-------
- A `.txt` file containing all information and matrices.
- A message printed to the console confirming the file was saved.

-------------
### Workflow:
-------------
1. **Open the File**: The file is opened for writing. If it fails to open, an error message is shown.
2. **Extract Parameters**: The number of cards (rows), attributes (columns), and tables is written to the file under `# Parameters`.
3. **Write Number of SETs**: The function writes how many SETs were found in each table.
4. **Write Statistics**: It calculates and writes the number of tables with 0 SETs, the probability of no SETs, and the average number of SETs.
5. **Write Matrices**: The matrices are written to the file with rows separated by spaces.
6. **Close the File**: After writing all data, the file is closed, and a confirmation message is shown on the console.
